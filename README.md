# Shader.tips

Hello! This is a repo that houses the shader.tips site.

shader.tips serves both as a place for my to finally put all of the links I have hoarded over the past few years, and also a place for me to direct people who ask "how do I get started with shaders?"

A lot of the content on the site will likely be biased towards Unity and VRChat focused shader content. That is simply what I am most familiar with. However, I am always interested in general content as well!

## If you would like to contribute content to the site, there are several ways to do so:
