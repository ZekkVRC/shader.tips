  description: Discusses "several features of the GeForce 8800 that enable high-quality, next-generation extensions to SpeedTree. First, silhouette clipping adds detail to branch and trunk outlines. Next, shadow mapping adds realistic self-shadowing at the level of individual leaves. Additionally, we further refine the lighting with a two-sided-leaf lighting model and high-dynamic-range (HDR) rendering. Finally, multisample antialiasing along with alpha to coverage provide very high visual quality, free from aliasing artifacts."
